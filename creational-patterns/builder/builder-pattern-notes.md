# Builder Pattern

The *builder pattern* simplifies the creation of objects by separating instantiation procedures into a set of methods that configure related properties.

As you can see in the example, this pattern makes it much simpler to create an object and the code is much easier to read. It also conveys information about different parameters that might be required.

### Guarantees & Uses

- Simplify constructor into logical sections
- Increase code readability
