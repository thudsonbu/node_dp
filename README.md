# Node DP
This repo contains useful examples of design patterns in node and notes to explain the reasoning behind them. So far there are examples of a blockchain, session based authentication, and data streaming and pipelines. There are also some smaller code snippets that I have found to be extremely useful in `utils` and some of the slightly more complicated JS topics in `tricky-js`. You can learn more about each of the subprojects in their respective readmes or within block comments in the code.
