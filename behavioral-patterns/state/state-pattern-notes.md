# State Pattern

The state pattern is a modified version of the strategy pattern. Instead of the strategy being determined by the context, the strategy is determined by the context's state. A good example is the behavior of an application based on whether or not a user is signed in. When the user is signed in, the index page redirects to the user's home page, if not the user is shown the general home page.
